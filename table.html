		<h1>GHANAIAN DAY NAMES</h1>

		<h3>CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF GHANAIAN DAY NAMES</h3>
	<P class="para">
		Ghanaian day names are an integral part of the country's cultural identity and heritage. In Ghana, traditional day names are assigned to individuals based on the day of the week they were born. These names are deeply rooted in Akan culture and are believed to have a significant influence on a person's character and destiny. Each day of the week is associated with a specific name, and these names are used in addition to one's given name. For example, "Kwame" is given to individuals born on a Saturday, while "Akosua" is given to those born on a Sunday. These day names hold a special place in Ghanaian society, reflecting the rich history and traditions of the Akan people and serving as a way to connect with the past while celebrating the uniqueness of each individual.Below is a table of Ghanaian day names and their repective male and female names.
